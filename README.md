Hit picking, deconvolution, and rearrangement

Testing out streamlit:
  Make programs for user to pick and allow user to upload data for processing
  In hit picking:
    Determine which data points to pick. Allow user to determine the change between positive and negative samples needed to identify a pick.
    Plot data and allow user to download hits.
  In deconvolution:
    Determine how to deconvolute a pooled hit list.
  In hit rearrangement:
    Determine how to rearrange hits into a final plate.
